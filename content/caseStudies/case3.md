      Renew Administration onboarded the payroll for 100 employees. The payroll
      was very manual to begin with. Business owners were receptive to changes
      and allowed us to automate and use the current TNA system. This software
      was incurring a monthly subscription fee, which we could see as a cost
      waste. Using the TNA to its full potential elevated managements time spent
      on payroll, and allowing them to focus on more detailed tasks within the
      business.

      By implementing new workflows, we created a more reliable, accurate and
      cost effective payroll function.
